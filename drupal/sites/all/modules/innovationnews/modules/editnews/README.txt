Edit News lists news by edit status, making the process of story editing easier
and more intuitive.


Installation
------------
Unpack the Innovation News module to your site's module directory
(e.g. /sites/all/modules) as you would unpack any other Drupal module. After
you unpack the Innovation News module, a module grouping will appear on the
admin/build/modules page which lists all Innovation News modules. In order for
Edit News to be enabled, the module named Innovation News must also be enabled.


Usage
-----
After you enable Edition Manager, an entry will be added to your Primary Links
menu entitled "Edition News". You can move or disable this link if you so
choose.

To access Edit News, use the "Edit News" link which was automatically added to
the Navigation menu. By default, Edit News will display news which has not
yet been published. If you wish, you can view other groupings of stories by
using the provided filter at the top of the page.

If there are any news stories which match the selected filter, the teasers of
those stories will be displayed on the page along with basic story information
and an "Edit" link. To publish a story, click that story's "Edit" link. You will
then be able to edit the story. When you are satisfied, expand the "Publishing
Options" form of that story, and check "Published". Click the "Save" button to
confirm your changes or the "Preview" button to preview any changes. If you
would rather delete the story, you can simply click the "Delete" button.

Please not that unless a user has the privelage "administer nodes" enabled, that
user will not be able to edit the news stories which are displayed by Edit News.


Uninstallation
--------------
Edit News does not create any database tables and does not provide
user-configurable settings. If you no longer plan to use this module, you can
simply disable it.


Credits
-------
Edit News and all other Innovation News modules were created specifically
for use in Innovation News, a web-to-print newspaper which has been developed by
the Open Publishing Lab at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Innovation
News has been imagined and fostered by Proffesor Matthew Bernius, Professor
Michael Riordan, and Professor Patricia Albanese.

Edit News was written by John Karahalis. Assistance and bug testing were
provided by Mark Newell, Robert J. Whitney, and the entire OPL team.
